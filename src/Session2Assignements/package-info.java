 * 
	1. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a while loop. 
	The factorial of a positive number n is given by: 
	factorial of n (n!) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n 
	
	2. Write a program to print fibonacci series (10 values). 
	A series where the next term is the sum of previous two terms. The first 
	two terms of the Fibonacci sequence is 0 followed by 1. 
	The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... 
	
	3. Write a program to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. 
	
	4. Write a program to check whether the current year is leap year or not. Users will enter a year value. 
	
	5. Write a program to print the first 10 prime numbers. 
	
	6. Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle. Users will enter the values for base and height of the triangle. 
	
	7. Write a program to print the sum of the first 20 natural numbers. 8. Write a program to reverse the elements of an array where the array size as well as the array values are entered by the user. 
	
	9. Write a program to print only even numbers till 50. 
	
	10. Write a program to print this output using a two-dimensional array.
